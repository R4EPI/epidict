# epidict: Epidemiology Data Dictionaries and Random Data Generators

The 'R4EPIs' project <https://r4epi.github.io/sitrep/> seeks to provide
a set of standardized tools for analysis of outbreak and survey data in
humanitarian aid settings. This package currently provides standardized
data dictionaries from Medecins Sans Frontieres Operational Centre
Amsterdam for outbreak scenarios (Acute Jaundice Syndrome, Cholera,
Diphtheria, Measles, Meningitis) and surveys (Retrospective mortality
and access to care, Malnutrition, Vaccination coverage and Event Based
Surveillance) - as described in the following
<https://scienceportal.msf.org/assets/standardised-mortality-surveys?utm_source=chatgpt.com>.
In addition, a data generator from these dictionaries is provided. It is
also possible to read in any Open Data Kit format data dictionary.
