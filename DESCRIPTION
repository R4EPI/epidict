Description: The 'R4EPIs' project <https://r4epi.github.io/sitrep/> seeks to provide 
    a set of standardized tools for analysis of outbreak and survey data in
    humanitarian aid settings. This package currently provides standardized data
    dictionaries from Medecins Sans Frontieres Operational Centre Amsterdam 
    for outbreak scenarios (Acute Jaundice Syndrome, Cholera, Diphtheria, 
    Measles, Meningitis) and surveys (Retrospective mortality and access to care, 
    Malnutrition, Vaccination coverage and Event Based Surveillance). In addition, 
    a data generator from these dictionaries is provided. It is also possible to 
    read in any Open Data Kit format data dictionary.
