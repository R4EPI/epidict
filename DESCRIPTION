Description: The 'R4EPIs' project <https://r4epi.github.io/sitrep> seeks to provide 
    a set of standardized tools for analysis of outbreak and survey data in
    humanitarian aid settings. This package currently provides standardized data
    dictionaries from MSF OCA for four outbreak scenarios (Acute Jaundice
    Syndrome, Cholera, Measles, Meningitis) and three surveys (Retrospective
    mortality and access to care, Malnutrition, and Vaccination coverage). In
    addition, a data generator from these dictionaries is provided.
