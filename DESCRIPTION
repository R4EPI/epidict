Description: The 'R4EPIs' project seeks to provide a set of standardized tools
    for analysis of outbreak and survey data in humanitarian aid settings. This
    package provides standardized data dictionaries for four outbreak scenarios
    (Acute Jaundice Syndrome, Cholera, Measles, Meningitis) and three surveys
    (Retrospective mortality and access to care, Malnutrition, and Vaccination
    coverage). In addition, a data generator from these dictionaries is provided.
