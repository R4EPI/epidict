Description: The 'R4EPIs' project <https://r4epi.github.io/sitrep/> seeks
    to provide a set of standardized tools for analysis of outbreak and
    survey data in humanitarian aid settings. This package currently
    provides standardized data dictionaries from Medecins Sans Frontieres
    Operational Centre Amsterdam for outbreak scenarios (Acute Jaundice
    Syndrome, Cholera, Diphtheria, Measles, Meningitis) and surveys
    (Retrospective mortality and access to care, Malnutrition, Vaccination
    coverage and Event Based Surveillance) - as described in the following
    <https://scienceportal.msf.org/assets/standardised-mortality-surveys?utm_source=chatgpt.com>.
    In addition, a data generator from these dictionaries is provided. It
    is also possible to read in any Open Data Kit format data dictionary.
